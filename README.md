# e-Very Day

## About
The application is a virtual diary mainly composed of images and videos. The main idea of the application is that a user makes at least one media (photo or video) entry per day so that a video montage consisting of the precious moments in their lives within a user-specified timeframe can be created by putting their daily media entries together as one video. To ensure that the user will remember to add a media entry to the application everyday, the application will send out a daily notification reminding the user to create a media entry. In addition, the application also allows the user to keep track of the events of their lives by enabling them to attach mood ratings and captions to the media entries that they have created. All together, the daily media entries, captions, moods ratings and the application-generated video montage can provide a summarized narrative of the userâ€™s life that they can look back on.
